# Experiment 5: Subqueries and Views

## AIM
To study and implement subqueries and views.

## THEORY

### Subqueries
A subquery is a query inside another SQL query and is embedded in:
- WHERE clause
- HAVING clause
- FROM clause

**Types:**
- **Single-row subquery**:
  Sub queries can also return more than one value. Such results should be made use along with the operators in and any.
- **Multiple-row subquery**:
  Here more than one subquery is used. These multiple sub queries are combined by means of ‘and’ & ‘or’ keywords.
- **Correlated subquery**:
  A subquery is evaluated once for the entire parent statement whereas a correlated Sub query is evaluated once per row processed by the parent statement.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```
### Views
A view is a virtual table based on the result of an SQL SELECT query.
**Create View:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
**Drop View:**
```sql
DROP VIEW view_name;
```

**Question 1**
--
Write a SQL query that retrieves the all the columns from the Table Grades, where the grade is equal to the minimum grade achieved in each subject.
--
Sample table: GRADES

<img width="644" height="271" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fda3c442-f1bb-454d-9dc3-ce1d9ac003c5" />
```sql
SELECT *
FROM GRADES g
WHERE grade = (
    SELECT MIN(grade)
    FROM GRADES
    WHERE subject = g.subject
);
```
**Output:**

**Question 2**
---
Write a query to display all the customers whose ID is the difference between the salesperson ID of Mc Lyon and 2001.
---
salesman table

| Name        | Type          |
|------------|---------------|
| salesman_id | numeric(5)   |
| name        | varchar(30)  |
| city        | varchar(15)  |
| commission  | decimal(5,2) |

customer table

| Name        | Type |
|------------|------|
| customer_id | int  |
| cust_name   | text |
| city        | text |
| grade       | int  |
| salesman_id | int  |
```sql
SELECT *
FROM customer
WHERE customer_id = (
    SELECT salesman_id - 2001
    FROM salesman
    WHERE name = 'Mc Lyon'
);
```
**Output:**

**Question 3**
---
From the following tables write a SQL query to find all orders generated by New York-based salespeople. Return ord_no, purch_amt, ord_date, customer_id, salesman_id.
